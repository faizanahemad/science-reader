Please review the code generated in this session with the following goals:

1. **Maintain Functionality**: Ensure all original and intended functionality is preserved.
2. **Code Quality & Error Correction**: Identify and correct any errors in logic, syntax, or behavior.
3. **Eliminate Redundancy**: Refactor to avoid duplicated code by reusing existing logic and following DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
4. **Apply Lean Coding Practices**: Remove unnecessary or bloated code, dependencies, or comments while keeping the code clear and maintainable.
5. **Adhere to SOLID Principles**: Structure the code to improve maintainability, readability, modularity, and potential for extension.
6. **Long-term Maintainability**: Ensure the resulting codebase is organized, clear, and easy to maintain, aiming for sustainable development.

If any of the above points require additional small edits or improvements beyond the original implementation, make those changes directly and briefly summarize them (if necessary). Otherwise, approve the code as ready for merging.
