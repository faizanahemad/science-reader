Look at the current tasks and what exactly we were doing and what files we were editing and what changes we already made and what is left. Write a detailed summary and hand-off document which can be used by the next AI agent to continue working on the task. Make sure to note down inputs, contraints, original user ask, what is done and what is left and other details which will help another agent to continue this work that we are doing that is pending.
Keep your focus on the current task list and current turn.
Do not modify or edit any file.
Just write the hand-over document in the chat and then close.
