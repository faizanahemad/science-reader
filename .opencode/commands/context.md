Explore the codebase and documentation and get context around what files need to be read and modified for this action or ask.
Read wide and deep to get code and documentation context.
Next write the information of what you found and what all files are needed to be read or touched with information on maybe what parts of those files need to be seen.
If possible also write what information you got from those files.
Do not modify or edit any file.
