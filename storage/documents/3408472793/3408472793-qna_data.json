[The big picture: Transformers for long sequences](https://medium.com/@lukas.noebauer/the-big-picture-transformers-for-long-sequences-890cc0e7613b)\nTo manage the n^2 time complexity and efficiently extend attention to longer documents, different strategies have been adopted. \n\nAs per the [Demystifying Transformers Architecture in Machine Learning](https://www.projectpro.io/article/transformers-architecture/840) article, the attention mechanism in a transformer network architecture enables it to capture long-range dependencies between words in a sentence, making it suitable for processing longer documents. Transformers utilize multi-head attention, which allows the model to attend to multiple representation subspaces in parallel, enhancing its ability to capture various types of relationships between words.\n\nThe [The big picture: Transformers for long sequences - Lukas N\u00f6bauer - Medium](https://medium.com/@lukas.noebauer/the-big-picture-transformers-for-long-sequences-890cc0e7613b) article discusses how the self-attention mechanism in the Transformer architecture comes with limitations when it comes to long sequences due to the quadratic dependency on the sequence length. To reduce this dependency, the article suggests two approaches: using sparse attention mechanisms that only attend to a subset of the input tokens instead of all of them, and using hierarchical attention mechanisms that attend to different levels of granularity in the input. These alternatives help reduce the computational complexity from quadratic to linear, making it possible to handle longer sequences.\n\nThe [A Comprehensive Guide to Attention Mechanism in Deep Learning for Everyone](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/11/comprehensive-guide-attention-mechanism-deep-learning/) emphasizes that the attention mechanism in deep learning models helps them selectively focus on essential input elements, improving prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. This ability to give more importance to certain input words over others enables the model to capture relevant information from longer documents.\n\nAccording to the [Content-Adaptive and Attention-Based Network for Hand Gesture Recognition](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/4/2041) document, the transformer-based network uses an adaptive sampling strategy to reduce computational consumption, which can be an effective method to extend attention to longer documents.\n\nThe [A Survey of Transformers - arXiv (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04554) document discusses various Transformer variants that address the challenge of processing long sequences due to the computation and memory complexity of the self-attention module.

(2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04371) document introduces a new approach called Poolingformer that uses a two-level attention schema. The first level employs a sliding window pattern to aggregate information from neighboring tokens, while the second level uses a larger window with pooling attention to increase receptive fields and reduce computational cost and memory consumption. This strategy has shown superior performance in long sequence tasks and can be applied to extremely long text sequences.\n\nIn conclusion, various strategies and modifications to the attention mechanism, such as sparse and hierarchical attention, adaptive sampling, and pooling, can be employed to extend attention to longer documents despite the n^2 time complexity.", "web_search"], ["804537225", "how are attention models used in computer vision?", "Attention models are used in various tasks in computer vision.

Definition, Types And Benefits | Indeed ...](https://in.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/attention-model)\nAttention models have been widely used in many domains of artificial intelligence including computer vision, and their popularity is due to their ability to focus selectively on parts of the input that are more important for performing a task effectively. They are used in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and recommender systems, and they also offer advantages such as improving the interpretability of neural networks and addressing challenges with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) ([An Attentive Survey of Attention Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02874)).\n\nIn the field of deep learning for point clouds, attention models have gained significant attention. Point clouds, which represent 3D geometric information without discretization, pose challenges in feature representation due to their unordered and irregular structure. To address this, attention mechanisms have been introduced to focus on important parts of the input data and capture sufficient feature representation. Attention models have been used in tasks such as 3D object detection, semantic segmentation, pose estimation, and point clouds completion ([Attention Models for Point Clouds in Deep Learning: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10788)).\n\nAttention mechanisms in computer vision tasks are used to enhance the performance of deep neural networks. They allow the model to focus on the most relevant features of the input and ignore the irrelevant ones, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the learning process. The advantages of using attention models in computer vision include improving accuracy and robustness, reducing computational cost and memory usage, and enhancing interpretability and explainability. However, attention mechanisms can also have disadvantages, such as increasing the complexity and instability of the model, introducing biases and errors, and limiting generalization and adaptation ([Attention Mechanisms for Computer Vision: Pros and Cons](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/what-advantages-disadvantages-using-attention)).\n\nAttention can be a stand-alone primitive for vision models instead of just an augmentation on top of convolutions. The authors of Stand-Alone Self-Attention in Vision Models argue that a pure self-attention vision model can outperform the baseline on ImageNet classification with 12% fewer FLOPS and 29% fewer parameters. On COCO object detection, a pure self-attention model matches the mAP of a baseline RetinaNet while having 39% fewer FLOPS and 34% fewer parameters ([Stand-Alone Self-Attention in Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05909)).\n\nIn addition, attention models are used to overcome the limitations of traditional Encoder-Decoder architectures. The attention model induces weights on the decoded input sequence, which gives an idea of the relevance of each token of context vector to the tokens of input vector of the decoder. These attention weights are used to build the context vector to input decoder, enabling the decoder to access the entire decoded input vector to generate the output ([A Survey of Attention Mechanism and Using Self-Attention Model for Computer Vision](https://medium.com/swlh/a-survey-of-attention-mechanism-and-using-self-attention-model-for-computer-vision-ed6195f486e)).\n\nFinally, attention-based models are one of the categories of deep learning-based image segmentation models. These models are used for semantic and instance-level segmentation and have been successful in various computer vision applications. However, specific details about attention models in computer vision applications are not provided in the given document ([Image Segmentation Using Deep Learning: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05566)).", "web_search"], ["1342142430", "how can attention be used in computer vision? short answer.", "Attention can be used in computer vision to improve the performance of tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and scene parsing.

Spatial attention helps locate and focus on specific regions of an image, channel attention selects informative features, and self-attention captures long-range dependencies and contextual information.\n\nIn recent advances, attention techniques in computer vision are becoming more popular and dominant compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as stated in [Recent Advances in Vision Transformer: A Survey and Outlook of ... ()](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01536). Vision Transformers (ViTs) have successfully solved various vision problems by focusing on long-range relationships using a self-attention mechanism, similar to traditional recurrent neural networks. ViTs benefit from training on large-scale unlabeled datasets and fine-tuning on other tasks with small datasets.\n\nAs mentioned in [A General Survey on Attention Mechanisms in Deep Learning ()](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.14263), attention mechanisms can be trained jointly with base models such as recurrent neural networks or convolutional neural networks.

Spatial attention represents the attention mechanism/attention mask on the feature map, while channel attention provides a weight for each channel, enhancing those particular channels that contribute the most towards learning, thus boosting the overall model.\n\nIn conclusion, attention mechanisms in computer vision help models focus on relevant features and regions of the input, improving accuracy and efficiency while reducing computational cost and memory usage.

The `score` function computes the attention energies by concatenating the hidden state and encoder outputs, applying a linear layer followed by a ReLU activation, and then calculating the dot product of the result with a learned vector `v`. The attention scores are then computed by applying a softmax to these energies. The attention scores can be used to weight the contribution of each encoder output when computing the context vector for the decoder.", null]], "extended_abstract": {}}
