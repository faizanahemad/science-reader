# Auto-Scroll Removal Changelog

**Date:** January 2025  
**Issue:** Unwanted programmatic scroll-to-bottom behaviors were interrupting users while reading previous messages during bot conversations.

## Overview
This document tracks the removal of all problematic auto-scroll behaviors in the chatbot UI that were causing interruptions during user reading sessions.

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Next Question Suggestions Auto-Scroll (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File:** `interface/common-chat.js`  
**Function:** `ensureSuggestionsVisible()` (lines 3534-3561)  
**Issue:** After every bot response completion, suggestions would auto-scroll into view, interrupting users reading previous messages.  
**Action:** Completely disabled the auto-scroll functionality while keeping the function structure intact.  
**Impact:** Next question suggestions will still appear but won't force scroll to show them.

### 2. ✅ Textarea Auto-Scroll (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Files:** 
- `interface/chat.js` (lines 32-38)
- `interface/common.js` (lines 102-106)

**Issue:** Typing or clicking in the message textarea (`#messageText`) triggered auto-scroll in the main chat view.  
**Action:** Disabled auto-scroll behavior in textarea callbacks and newline addition functions.  
**Impact:** Textarea will no longer cause unwanted scrolling in the main chat area.

### 3. ✅ Conversation Loading Scroll (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**File:** `interface/common-chat.js`  
**Function:** `ConversationManager.setActiveConversation()` (lines 404-408)  
**Issue:** Loading or switching conversations would auto-scroll to bottom.  
**Action:** Disabled both immediate and delayed (150ms) scroll-to-bottom calls.  
**Impact:** Users can now switch conversations without losing their reading position.

### 4. ✅ Chat Tab Activation Scroll (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**File:** `interface/common-chat.js`  
**Function:** `activateChatTab()` (lines 3028-3030)  
**Issue:** Switching between assistant/search/finchat tabs would auto-scroll to bottom.  
**Action:** Disabled auto-scroll when activating chat tabs.  
**Impact:** Tab switching no longer disrupts user's reading position.

### 5. ✅ URL-based Message Scroll (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**File:** `interface/common-chat.js`  
**Function:** `ChatManager.renderMessages()` (lines 2923-2927)  
**Issue:** Loading conversations with message IDs in URL would auto-scroll to target message.  
**Action:** Disabled `scrollIntoView()` but kept highlight effect for visual feedback.  
**Impact:** Deep-linked messages will still be highlighted but won't force scroll.

### 6. ✅ Page Initialization Scrolls (LOW PRIORITY)
**Files:**
- `interface/shared.js` (lines 32-36, 56-58)
- `interface/chat.js` (lines 180-182)

**Issue:** Page load and initialization would trigger scroll-to-bottom.  
**Action:** Disabled `scrollToBottom()` calls and window scroll resets on page initialization.  
**Impact:** Pages will load without forcing scroll position.

## Behaviors Preserved

### Manual Scroll-to-Bottom Button
**File:** `interface/common-chat.js` (lines 3257-3259)  
**Status:** ✅ KEPT - User-initiated scrolling via button click  
**Reason:** This is intentional user action, not automatic interruption.

### Doubt Manager Scrolls
**File:** `interface/doubt-manager.js` (lines 330, 460, 610)  
**Status:** ✅ KEPT - Only affects separate doubt chat modal  
**Reason:** These operate in a separate modal context and don't interrupt main chat reading.

### Message Deletion Recovery Scroll
**File:** `interface/common-chat.js` (lines 2296-2297)  
**Status:** ✅ KEPT - Contextually appropriate after user action  
**Reason:** User explicitly deleted a message, scrolling to show result is expected.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Textarea Testing:** Type in message box, click in/out - should not cause main chat scroll
2. **Bot Response Testing:** Send message, let bot respond completely - should not auto-scroll to suggestions
3. **Conversation Switching:** Switch between conversations - should maintain reading position
4. **Tab Switching:** Switch between assistant/search/finchat tabs - should not auto-scroll
5. **Deep Links:** Access URLs with message IDs - should highlight but not scroll
6. **Page Load:** Refresh page or load initially - should not force scroll position

## Potential Side Effects

1. **Next Question Suggestions:** May sometimes appear off-screen and require manual scrolling to see
2. **Deep Links:** Users may need to manually scroll to highlighted messages
3. **New Conversations:** May not automatically show the latest message when switching conversations

## Rollback Information

All changes are commented out rather than deleted, making rollback simple by uncommenting the relevant sections. Each disabled section is marked with clear comments explaining the reason for removal.

## Additional Findings (Deep Dive)

After comprehensive deep dive, found and fixed these additional auto-scroll behaviors:

### 7. ✅ Delete Last Message Auto-Scroll (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File:** `interface/common-chat.js` (lines 2297-2299)  
**Function:** `ChatManager.deleteLastMessage()`  
**Issue:** After deleting the last message, chat would auto-scroll to bottom.  
**Action:** Disabled auto-scroll but kept focus on message input.  
**Impact:** Deleting messages won't force scroll position change.

### 8. ✅ Conversation Loading Window Resets (HIGH PRIORITY)  
**File:** `interface/common-chat.js` (lines 363-365)  
**Function:** `ConversationManager.setActiveConversation()`  
**Issue:** Loading conversations would reset document and window scroll to top.  
**Action:** Disabled both `$(document).scrollTop(0)` and `$(window).scrollTop(0)`.  
**Impact:** Switching conversations maintains current scroll position.

### 9. ✅ Sidebar Toggle Scroll Resets (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**File:** `interface/interface.js` (lines 39-41)  
**Function:** `toggleSidebar()`  
**Issue:** Hiding sidebar would reset scroll to top of page.  
**Action:** Disabled document and window scroll resets.  
**Impact:** Sidebar toggle no longer affects scroll position.

### 10. ✅ Details/Summary ScrollIntoView (LOW PRIORITY)
**Files:**
- `interface/interface.html` (line 1840)
- `interface/shared.html` (line 202)  

**Issue:** Clicking to close details elements would scroll to summary.  
**Action:** Disabled `scrollIntoView()` on details close.
