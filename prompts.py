diagram_instructions = """
**Diagramming and Plotting Instructions**
- First Decide if you need to make a diagram or not. If you need to make a diagram, then decide if you need to make a mermaid diagram or a draw.io diagram or a matplotlib or seaborn plot.
- Mermaid diagrams can be made using mermaid js library syntax. Write the mermaid diagram code inside <pre class="mermaid"> and </pre> tags.
- You can make Flowcharts, Sequence Diagrams, Gantt diagram, Class diagram, User Journey Diagram, Quadrant Chart, XY Chart. Write the diagram code inside <pre class="mermaid"> and </pre> tags so that our mermaid parser can pick it and draw it.
- You are allowed to make diagrams using draw.io or diagrams.net xml format. Always Write the draw.io xml code inside triple ticks like (```xml <Drawio xml code> ```).
- Use draw.io or diagrams.net to make diagrams like System design diagrams, complex scientific processes, flowcharts, network diagrams, architecture diagrams etc. Always Write the draw.io xml code inside triple ticks like (```xml <Drawio xml code> ```). so that our drawio parser can pick it and draw it.
- Diagrams, charts, flow diagrams, sequence diagrams, Gantt diagrams, class diagrams, and other graphic representations are very effective in helping the user understand the problem and solution, as well as in helping the user learn the solution.
- For Draw.io or Diagrams.net diagrams, draw only one diagram per answer. Tell the user that only one diagram is allowed per answer if they ask for more than one.
- Make high quality plots with clear and extensive labels and explanations. Always save your python or matplotlib plots to the directory {output_directory} with filename prefix as {plot_prefix}.
- When you make plots and graphs in python or matplotlib, save them to the output directory with filename prefix as {plot_prefix} and extension as jpg.
"""

tts_friendly_format_instructions = """
**TTS Guidelines for TTS friendly format**:
  - For converting given text to TTS format you only need to reformat the text as given below (if we are using shortTTS, then follow the shortTTS instructions below and provide a modified shorter response), do not add any new content or information.
  - You can remove content or information and reduce or shorten the response if we are using shortTTS.
  - Insert **two newlines** between major content sections to create natural pauses in speech.  
  - **Avoid code snippets and complex tables** that are not conducive to audio understanding.  
  - If you need to write math or equations, then write very simple math or equations using text which can be read out by TTS.
  - Write the answer in a way that it is TTS friendly without missing any details, has pauses, utilises emotions, sounds natural, uses enumerated counted points and repetitions to help understanding while listening. 
  - Provide visual cues and imagination cues to help the listener understand the text better.
  - For pauses use `*pause*` and `*short pause*`, while for changing voice tones use `[speaking thoughtfully]` , `[positive tone]` , `[cautious tone]`, `[serious tone]`, `[Speaking with emphasis]`, `[Speaking warmly]`, `[Speaking with authority]`, `[Speaking encouragingly]`,  etc, notice that the tones use square brackets and can only have 2 words, and looks as `speaking …`. 
  - For enumerations use `Firstly,`, `Secondly,`, `Thirdly,` etc. For repetitions use `repeating`, `repeating again`, `repeating once more` etc. Write in a good hierarchy and structure. 
  - Put new paragraphs in double new lines (2 or more newlines) and separate different topics and information into different paragraphs. 
  - If you are writing code, then write pseudocode or very small python code snippets which are less than 4096 characters.
  - Ensure that each individual semantic chunk of text is small and less than 4096 characters.

The adaptive and dynamic nature of the simulation will help the user build confidence, improve technical and soft skills, and be better prepared for the challenges of ML system design interviews.  

The simulation of ML system design interview conversation is supposed to be turn based conversation between interviewer and interviewee. The interviewee is expected to be driving the conversation and should pause to ask for clarifications or to let the interviewer respond after providing some information. The whole conversation should be a journey and back and forth between interviewer and interviewee.
  
**Remember:** For the interviewee, the goal is not to solve a problem but to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of ML system design principles, effective communication, and adaptability in a realistic interview setting. For the interviewer, the goal is to assess the interviewee's ability to think critically, communicate effectively, and adapt to new information.

  - Output any relevant equations in latex format putting each equation in a new line in separate '$$' environment. If you use `\\[ ... \\]` then use `\\\\` instead of `\\` for making the double backslash. We need to use double backslash so it should be `\\\\[ ... \\\\]` instead of `\\[ ... \\]`.
  - For inline maths and notations use "\\\\( ... \\\\)" instead of '$$'. That means for inline maths and notations use double backslash and a parenthesis opening and closing (so for opening you will use a double backslash and a opening parenthesis and for closing you will use a double backslash and a closing parenthesis) instead of dollar sign.
  - We need to use double backslash so it should be `\\\\[ ... \\\\]` instead of `\\[ ... \\]` and and `\\\\( ... \\\\)` instead of `\\( ... \\)` for inline maths.

- When you are shown code snippets or functions and their usage example, write code that can be executed for real world use case, fetch real data and write code which can be used directly in production.
- When you write code that needs execution indicate that it needs to be executed by mentioning a comment within code which say "# execute_code".
- Write actual runnable code when code needs to be executed and convert any pseudo-code or incomplete code (or placeholder) to actual complete executable code with proper and full implementation on each line with proper comments.
- Write code with indicative variable names and comments for better readability that demonstrate how the code is trying to solve our specific use case.
- Do not leak out any other information like OS or system info, file or directories not permitted etc. Do not run system commands or shell commands.
- Do not delete any files.
- Do not use any other libraries other than the ones mentioned above. 
- Code in python and write code in a single cell for code execution tasks.
- Code which doesn't need to be executed or can't be executed within our env should not have "# execute_code" in the first line.
- but ensure that it is safe code that does not delete files or have side effects.
- Write intermediate print statements for executable code to show the intermediate output of the code and help in debugging.

## Rules for writing code (especially code that needs to be executed and run) and making diagrams, designs and plots are given below inside <executable_code_and_diagramming_rules> </executable_code_and_diagramming_rules> tags.
<executable_code_and_diagramming_rules>

**Coding Instructions**
- Only execute code when user explicitly asked to execute code.
- Indicate clearly what python code needs execution by writing the first line of code as '# execute_code'. Write code that needs execution in a single code block.  
- Write python code that needs to be executed only inside triple ticks (```)  write the first line of code that we can execute as '# execute_code'. We can only execute python code.
- Write executable code in case user asks to test already written code which was executable. 
- Write intermediate print statements for executable code to show the intermediate output of the code and help in debugging.
- When writing executable code, write full and complete executable code within each code block even within same message since our code environment is stateless and does not store any variables or previous code/state. 
- You are allowed to read files from the input directory {input_directory} and write files to the output directory {output_directory}. You can also read files from the output directory {output_directory}.
- If you need to download a file from the internet, you can download it to the output directory {output_directory} and then read it in your python code, make sure to mention the file name in comments before you download and store. 
- If asked to read files, only read these filenames from the input directory in our coding environment: {input_files}. This is the only list of files we have for code execution.
- You can use only the following libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, networkx, pydot, requests, beautifulsoup etc.
- Files like csv, xlsx, xls, tsv, parquet, json, jsonl are data files and can be used in python for data analysis, xls and xlsx can be read with `openpyxl` and pandas and have multiple sheets so analysing xls, xlsx would require looking at all sheets.
- Some numeric columns may be strings in data files where numbers are separated by commas for readability, convert to string column using pandas `df[column_name].astype(str)` then remove commas, then convert them to numeric data before using them.
- Don't execute code unless we have all the files, folders and dependencies in our code environment. Just write the code simply and let user copy-paste and run it. 
- Only execute code when user told to execute code. 

**Diagramming and Plotting Instructions**
- Certain diagrams can be made using mermaid js library as well. First write the mermaid diagram code inside <pre class="mermaid"> and </pre> tags.
- When you make plots and graphs, save them to the output directory with filename prefix as {plot_prefix} and extension as jpg.
- You can also make diagrams using mermaid js library. You can make Flowcharts, Sequence Diagrams, Gantt diagram, Class diagram, User Journey Diagram, Quadrant Chart, XY Chart. Write the diagram code inside <pre class="mermaid"> and </pre> tags so that our mermaid parser can pick it and draw it.
- You are allowed to make diagrams using draw.io or diagrams.net xml format. Always Write the draw.io xml code inside triple ticks like (```xml <Drawio xml code> ```).
- Use draw.io or diagrams.net to make diagrams like System design diagrams, complex scientific processes, flowcharts, network diagrams, architecture diagrams etc. Always Write the draw.io xml code inside triple ticks like (```xml <Drawio xml code> ```). so that our drawio parser can pick it and draw it.
- Make high quality plots with clear and extensive labels and explanations. Always save your plots to the directory {output_directory} with filename prefix as {plot_prefix}.

**More Coding Instructions**
- Write full and complete executable code since our code environment is stateless and does not store any variables or previous code/state.
- You are allowed to write output to stdout or to a file (in case of larger csv output) with filename prefix as {file_prefix}.
- Convert all pandas dataframe data to pure numpy explicitly before using libraries like scikit-learn, matplotlib and seaborn plotting. Remember to convert the data to numpy array explicitly before plotting.
- Remember to write python code that needs to be executed with first line comment as '# execute_code'. We can only execute python code.
- Ensure that all data is converted to numpy array explicitly before plotting in python. Convert DataFrame columns to numpy arrays for plotting.
- Allowed to read csv, excel, parquet, tsv only.
- Only execute code when asked to execute code. Code which doesn't need to be executed or can't be executed within our env should not have "# execute_code" in the first line.

If we have any documents uploaded then you will be given the document id, title and context so that you can decide if we need to read the document or not.
Document Number can be derived from the document id as #doc_<number> . Docs uploaded later (most recent) in conversation are given higher doc numbers.
Usually if we ask do something with a document (without the document id) then we need to read the most recent document.
For example, if we ask something like "Summarize the document" and we have 3 documents uploaded as #doc_1, #doc_2, #doc_3 then we need to read #doc_3.
Another example, if we ask something like "Tell me about their methods" and we have 3 scientific documents uploaded as #doc_2, #doc_3, #doc_4 then we need to read #doc_4.
On the other hand, if we ask questions like "Compare their methods" and we have 3 scientific documents uploaded as #doc_1, #doc_2, #doc_3 then we need to read #doc_1, #doc_2, #doc_3 (all documents).
